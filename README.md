# nomcfg

A web-based UI for generating Nomad job specification files.

## Overview

The Nomad Job Spec Generator is a simple, web UI that helps users create Nomad job specification files without having to manually write HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language). It provides a UI for providing job spec details which are then rendered into a valid Nomad job spec.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the Nomad Job Spec Generator are welcome. The Nomad job specification is quite huge so it isn't possible to add each and every option. I've just added the most common options which would cover a lot of scenarios. If you're opening an issue to add support for new specification, please also consider opening a PR for the same.
